# Pairing-2-HC-05-Bluetooth-Module

This github includes the complete code and circuit for communicating between 2 Arduino Wirelessly by using 2 HC-05 Bluetooth Module.

Firstly we have to pair the 2 Bluetooth devices with each other and after that you have to procees with the above circuit and code.

AT Commands for Slave Bluetooth Module are:

1. AT
2. AT+ROLE=0
3. AT+ADDR?

AT Commands for Master Bluetooth Module are:

1. AT
2. AT+ROLE=1
3. AT+BIND=00XX,XX,XXXXXX (MAC Address of Slave Bluetooth Module)

# For Pairing Connection

EN = 3.3V
5V/VCC = 5V/VCC
GND = GND
RX = RX
TX = TX
